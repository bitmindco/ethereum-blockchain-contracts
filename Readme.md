- OpenValueCoin v1.0 -

This cryptocurrency creates a public tradeable fungible token
in the Ethereum Blockchain which may be used in an Open Value Network
(see http://ovn.space for a definition of OVN) to formalize flows of value
in a trustable way.

Initially, this token is fungible in order to be conceived as an internal
currency in one OVN, which can be exchanged by services within an existing
network or as a reputation mechanism. It may also serve as a "value-parser"
for investors who want to invest external capital in fiat currencies in 
an OVN.

It may be adquired by providing work value (being payed by the network) but
also in a crypto-currencies exchange or an investment web platform.

As other cryptoassets, the fixed market cap created in this contract
will be initially owned by the contract creator. According to this, 
it is important to deploy it from an Ethereum account democratically owned
by the OVN in which it is gonna be used. To do this, the creation of the 
currency should take place transparently and providing a Custodian Agreement 
(see http://ovn.space/?p=70) to guarantee the decentralization of the 
issuing power and the initial distribution of value within the community.

This first version is based on the Standarized Contract APIs of Ethereum
(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs) but may
be extended and improved for other purposes, depending of the kind of value
which is gonna be measured in the currency, or to serve as a seed for several
currencies related with the different flows of value within an OVN, which
may be parsed or exchanged by other sorts of value (or crypto-currencies) 
according to specific value equations defined by the corresponding community.
